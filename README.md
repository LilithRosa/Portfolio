# Portfolio
Examples of code from my personal projects.

I'm an amateur programmer with some experience in Unreal Engine 5 and hope to one day go back to school to finish my degree in software engineering and design.  I started coding in highschool and stuck with it through a stint in prison, learning and relearning some basics and some fairly advanced concepts.  I hope to use this repo as my Portfolio and a means to show my work isn't just about video games.
